# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Captstone Project

This is my project for the 9th course - the so called *Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods* developed and teached by IBM on Coursera.

## 👉 For my fellow student collagues who grades me
I put the code in two Jupyter Notebooks. You can jump directly to the commit of that Notebook by clicking:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x with the usual data librariers contained in Anaconda (e.g.: `Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn`)
- Jupyter Notebook
- `folium` (for map rendering)
- `geopy.geocoders` (to convert adresses into longitudes and latitudes)

You need a (free) Foursquare Developer Account if you want to replicate the code for other cities. Additionally, you can run the Notebook without developer account as I provided the downloaded data.

### Installing

👉🏻 under construction 👷🏻‍♂️- *I will provide instructions in the future ...*


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Built With

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - awesome user interface for Jupyter Notebooks
